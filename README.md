## Getting started

- Clone repository
- Configure database server
- Configure database settings in `application.properties`
- In one terminal: `./gradlew build --continuous`, this will watch for changes and recompile the application whenever it changed.
- In a second terminal: `./gradlew bootRun`, this will run a development version of the server which automatically restarts if something changed.
- Open http://localhost:8080
